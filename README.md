#### **2. Historical Development of Therapeutic Communities in Germany**  
- **Early Influences**:  
  - The concept of TCs in Germany was influenced by American models like Synanon, Daytop, and Phoenix House, which emphasized peer support and communal living .

  - **1960s-1980s**: The establishment of TCs in Germany was part of a broader European movement that rejected traditional psychiatric and methadone treatments, focusing instead on drug-free, community-based approaches .  
  - **1981**: The founding of the European Federation of Therapeutic Communities (EFTC) in DÃ¼sseldorf, Germany, marked a significant step in formalizing the TC movement across Europe. German pioneers like Martin Lutterjohan played a crucial role in this initiative .
